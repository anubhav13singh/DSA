    <h3>A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

        Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.
        
        You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
        
        You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time</h3>
        <pre>Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
            Output: 2
            Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.</pre>
            <script>

function findPeakElement(nums) {
    let start = 0;
    let end = nums.length - 1;
    while (start < end) {
        let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
        if(nums[mid+1] > nums[mid]) {
            start = mid+1;
        } else if(nums[mid-1] > nums[mid]) {
            end = mid-1;
        } else {
            return mid;
        }
    }
    return start;
